# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on systematically cleaning up the TaxiNow codebase to resolve ESLint and TypeScript errors while maintaining functionality. The cleanup will address technical debt that has been documented in the changelog and improve code maintainability, type safety, and development experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ESLint Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint errors resolved so that the codebase follows consistent coding standards and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL return zero ESLint errors
2. WHEN unused imports are identified THEN the system SHALL remove them without breaking functionality
3. WHEN unused variables are identified THEN the system SHALL remove them or mark them as intentionally unused
4. WHEN unescaped JSX entities are found THEN the system SHALL properly escape them using HTML entities
5. WHEN `let` or `var` can be replaced with `const` THEN the system SHALL make the replacement
6. WHEN React hook dependencies are missing or unnecessary THEN the system SHALL fix the dependency arrays

### Requirement 2: TypeScript Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved so that the application builds successfully and has proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run typecheck` THEN the system SHALL return zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN Firebase database instances could be null THEN the system SHALL add proper null checks
3. WHEN `any` types are used THEN the system SHALL replace them with specific TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN missing type definitions are identified THEN the system SHALL install or create proper type declarations
5. WHEN function signatures don't match their usage THEN the system SHALL correct the type definitions
6. WHEN properties are accessed on potentially undefined objects THEN the system SHALL add proper null/undefined checks

### Requirement 3: Code Quality Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved code quality and maintainability so that future development is more efficient and less error-prone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN undefined components are referenced THEN the system SHALL either import them or remove the references
2. WHEN duplicate configuration exists THEN the system SHALL consolidate to single definitions
3. WHEN error handling is missing THEN the system SHALL add appropriate try-catch blocks and error handling
4. WHEN type interfaces are missing THEN the system SHALL create proper TypeScript interfaces
5. WHEN authentication context properties are missing THEN the system SHALL update the context type definitions

### Requirement 4: Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a user of the TaxiNow application, I want all existing functionality to continue working after code cleanup so that no features are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code cleanup is performed THEN all existing application features SHALL continue to function correctly
2. WHEN imports are removed THEN the system SHALL verify no functionality depends on them
3. WHEN variables are removed THEN the system SHALL ensure they are truly unused
4. WHEN type definitions are changed THEN the system SHALL maintain API compatibility
5. WHEN error handling is added THEN the system SHALL not change the user experience

### Requirement 5: Systematic Cleanup Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleanup process to be systematic and incremental so that issues can be tracked and verified at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing errors THEN the system SHALL address one error category at a time
2. WHEN each category is completed THEN the system SHALL run linting/type checking to verify fixes
3. WHEN errors are fixed THEN the system SHALL not introduce new errors in other areas
4. WHEN cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain git history with clear commit messages
5. WHEN critical errors are identified THEN the system SHALL prioritize them over cosmetic issues
